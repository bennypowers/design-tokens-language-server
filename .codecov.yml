# Coverage Approach:
# - Unit tests: Run with -coverprofile (traditional approach) - 52.1%
# - Integration tests: Run with Go 1.20+ cross-process coverage - 36.4%
# - Merged: Combined using gocovmerge - 64.5% total
#
# The integration tests spawn the LSP server as a subprocess (built with -cover),
# which writes coverage data to GOCOVERDIR. This is then converted and merged
# with unit test coverage for a complete picture.

# Ignore test files and non-library code from coverage
